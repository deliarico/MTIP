# The Multi-connection Tactile Internet Protocol (MTIP)

## Models

This section presents the models developed for MTIP.

* Promela models: ``ModelA.pml``, ``ModelB_Losses.pml`` and ``ModelB_NoLoss.pml`` are models developed using the Promela language to check the correctness of the protocol. Further information in [DOI: 10.1145/3479242.3487328](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3479242.3487328).

* Uppaal model: ``UppaalModel.pml`` is the model developed in the Uppaal tool to check the performance of the protocol. It also presents the results obtained verifying different deadline values and dissimilar sublinks.
